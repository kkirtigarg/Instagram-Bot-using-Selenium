The project was to create an instagram bot that would utilize automated processes, through the use of Selenium in Python, to perform various actions on Instagram, such as logging into an Instagram account, following and unfollowing various Instagram handles, searching for different Instagram handles, and liking/viewing their posts and stories. The main objective of the project was to identify popular food bloggers on Instagram, which was accomplished by initially searching for food bloggers and then narrowing down the search to the top 5 handles based on the number of followers they had.

Once the top food bloggers were identified, the project involved collecting information about their followers, such as the number of posts they had made in the last three days, the content of their posts to identify the latest hashtags used in the food industry, and the number of likes each post received. To facilitate this, the project used the Pandas library in Python. The likes to follower ratio was calculated by taking the average number of likes on each post and dividing it by the number of followers. Finally, the data was presented using histograms and pie charts.
